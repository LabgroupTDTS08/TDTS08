## Alghorithm to decrease the complexity
To the decrease the complexity but still not increase the cykles with more than 5 % we took the easy alghorithm and took down every parameter and took it down as much that we still was in the  5% ratio and then went to the next parameter , and then went down more and did the same for all parameters. Some paremeters did effect more,almost all the parameters intill the floatpoint and 
## How the complexity affect the pipeline
