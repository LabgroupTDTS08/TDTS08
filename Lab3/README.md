## Alghorithm to decrease the complexity
To the decrease the complexity but still not increase the cykles with more than 5 % we took the easy alghorithm and took down every parameter and took it down as much that we still was in the  5% ratio and then went to the next parameter , and then went down more and did the same for all parameters. Some paremeters did effect more,almost all the parameters intill the floatpoint and
the integer multiplication did affect the cycles significant. So the program go.ss does not use any floating points at all and just very few integer multiplications. Also you can discouse how the later parameters can change alot because of the parameter we changed before, like the rru that went up from the default and also went upp 100 % which is a big increase. The algorithm meaby is not the best but it takes down the or have the same size as the default eccept from the rru. 
## How the complexity affect the pipeline
We had 9 different parameters tha we could change -fetch:speed (allowed range: 1-4), decode:width (allowed range: 1-16), issue:width (allowed range: 1-8) ,-commit:width (allowed range: 1-8), -ruu:size (allowed range: 1-32), -res:ialu (allowed range: 1-4), -res:imult (allowed range: 1-4), -res:fpalu (allowed range: 1-2), -res:fpmult (allowed range: 1-2
