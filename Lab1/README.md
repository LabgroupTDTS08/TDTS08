# Labroration 1
  1. The array A[] is spatial locality because it has many different elemts close to each other. The loop variable i on other hand is just updating from the same position in the memory so it is temporal locality.
  2. Test1 with cache1 gives 19 hits between two misses, Test1 witch cache 2 gives 9 hits between misses, Test2 with cache1 gives 39 hits between misses, Test2 with cache 2 gives 19 hits between misses.
  3. Test1 with cache1 gives 800585 misses, Test1 witch cache2 gives 1558207 misses, Test2 with cache1 gives 10596833 misses, Test2 with cache2 gives 1581391.

  4. For low number of sets the associativity is important for the miss-ration, but when the sets go up you se that the associativity does not matter so much anymore.
