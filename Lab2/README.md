#Laboration 2
  1. The operand LB is a operand that is loading a byte from mamory to a register. So first it (IF) fetch the intruction and then (DA) decode it to a opcode for LB, then (CO) calculate the effective adresses for the memory and the register, then (FO) fetch the byte from the memory and (EX) put the byte in the register. The last stage (WB) does not happend here because no result is needed to be stored.
  2. The operand ADD first (IF) fetch the intruction and (DA) decode the op-code and the adressing type, then (CO) calculate the effective adresses depending on which adress type, then (FO) fetch the values that should be added to the ALU-register, (EX) executs the addition in the ALU and then (WB) stores the result to the main memory.
  3. For the program run with branch predictor "taken" the program gets 16314464 total number of branches executed and 8730602 total number of branches committed, which means it took avery second prediction right. For branch prediction "bimod" the program gets 10631235 total number of branches executed and 8730602 total number of branches committed, which means that almost 85 % of the prediction is right. For the branch prediction "2lev" 11358589 total number of branches executed and 8730602 total number of branches committed, which is about 80% right. For branch prediction "combo" the program gets 10586746 # total number of branches executed and 8730602 total number of branches committed, which is better then "bimod". The branch predicter "perfect" gets 100% right predictions.
