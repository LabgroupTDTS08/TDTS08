#Laboration 4
In lab 4 we have analysed a basic block in the benchmark grogram go.ss and optimised it according to vliw designed but also taken in consideration what material is needed for the code to run with the vliw design. The basic block index is 1023, its start adress is 0x00409750, its end adress is 0x004097b0 and it have 12 instructions in it. The basic block begins by loading 2 values that then gets left shifted and then gets added to a different register before the branch instruction came (see appendix for source code). Within the code we found 11 RAW dependencies within it that had to be taken care of for the vliw design scheme to run. The first ones was between the load and shift instructions (row 50, 68 and row 58, 70) because the same registers are being used. After that there are dependencies between the load, add and load instructions that follows (row 78, 80, 88 and row 90, 98, a0). lastly the branch instruction is dependet on the load instruction in row 60. All this dependencies are documented under the graph_file in appendix with the structur that the adress to the right is dependent of the result of the adress to the left.


The benchmark program we examined was go.ss and the basic block index was 1023 with Futher information can be founnd in the appendix. In the code we had a mix of load, add and shift instructions and the block ended with a branchs instruction. Within the code we found 11 dependencies that can be seen under the graph file in the appendix.
